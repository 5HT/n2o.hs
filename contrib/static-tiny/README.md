static-tiny
-----------

A 300 loc static file server based on connect@1.9.2

The server is not a toy as the original code from
connect.static middleware is tiny but feature-rich.
For example it supports conditional and range requests.

The MIME types table is very minimal though. A few image types would
be a great addition.
